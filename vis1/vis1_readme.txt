README FILE FOR VISUALIZATION ONE "THE INFLUENCE OF TRUMP TWEETS"

ORIGINAL DATA SETS
www.trumptwitterarchive.com - I selected three tweets about stories that have been labeled as "false or misleading" and captured the date they were tweeted.
www.mediacloud.org - I ran a dashboard search for the subjects "clinton and uranium", "Obama and wiretaps", and "the deep state" with the search timeframe for one month before and one month after each tweet selected above
The search yeilded the number of sentances contaning those terms that appeared in US Mainstream Media each day during the time period.
the data was consolidated onto the data.csv file that is in this folder. Each topic was given its own label "UR, DS, WT" and the values for daily mentions make up the second column.The third column of data was more difficult. The originial visualization only acceppted MM/DD/YYYY format and each of my data sets consisted of a different date range. To solve this, I standardized the date range to demonstrate a generic 60-day period rather than a specific time range.
