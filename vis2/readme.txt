Hi Dhrumil, I obtained my raw data essentially already in the perfect form for analysis - Buzzfeed, who collected the data, had helpfully provided the summary statistics on their github repo (found here, in the table under 'Enagement by Truthfulness - averages': https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-10-facebook-fact-check/blob/master/notebooks/facebook-fact-check.ipynb). This table provided the data separated out over types of engagements (share,reactions, comments), but I just needed an aggregate total of all the engagements for each page, so I just performed a simple addition of the three types of engagement using Excel, and then manually entered the data into a JSON file to be used for my D3 (I figured given it was a very small dataset that this would be the simplest, most agile way to get it into JSON form :) 

Thanks so much again for the course! It was really an amazing experience.
