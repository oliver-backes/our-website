Arjun's README notes:

The original data source was Google Trends www.googletrends.com. 

I searched for the phrase "Fake News" and set the time period to different ranges - last two year aggregate, then last two years broken into three month quarters. 

I downloaded the geographic interest data in the format provided in 'sample googletrends output.csv

I then pasted the data into one csv file in the columns provided in the D3's template. vis4.csv shows the consolidated dataset. I then added a date range to help build a drop down list to filter by date range. 

A link to the D3 source is available on the second page titled 'Across the World'.

Scrum Master was Jake and Product Owner was Arjun.

Retrospective was conducted on Slack as the team was travelling over the final weekend.
