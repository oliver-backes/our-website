DATA PRESENTATION

I used the data presented in fake-original.csv as the basis for my analysis.  This had been scraped from the Google Chrome BS Detector Extension by users on Kaggle.com.  of the approximately 12,000 articles presented, I conducted analysis to determine that 405 of these were directly targeted at the Clinton and  Trump campaigns in the lead up to the 2016 US Election and determined whether they were positive or negative in their coverage. 

I used python to convert the css file into a json file, ensuring it was correctly formatted to fit my d3js requirements.

D3js MANIPULATION

The largest change I have made to the d3js is changing the graphic from three categories into four (pro Clinton, anti Clinton, pro Trump, anti Trump).  I have also made small tweaks to make the slider work better and integrated the code of the menu bar into my page.
