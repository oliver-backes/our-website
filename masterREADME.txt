Hi Dhrumil,

This is the master README for team B3's final project. Below I will include a rundown of the various artifacts/deliverables for the project, as well as where they can be found (if they're not contained in this README).

Trello Board/User Stories: https://trello.com/b/G8el0ROH/b3-fake-news

Burndown Chart:

Collaboration in Github: The bulk of our commenting on other's code and/or assistance in fixing bugs etc... happened in person or via Slack. We all sought to make substantive changes to the site in separate feature branches and then merge those changes back in to the master branch. Commits and pull requests include documentation of the changes made. 

Scrum Meetings: see file "B3 Scrum Log.xlsx" in github repo

Retrospective (took place in Slack, reproduced below):

READMEs for Individual Pages: Each team member has produced a README file that discusses their data, the data transformation, their visualzation and any changes to it etc... per project guidelines. Those files can be found in the visualization-specific folders in the github repo (vis1, vis2, etc...).
