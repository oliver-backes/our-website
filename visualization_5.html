		Effects on Trust in Media
	</p></h1>
</center>

<p>
	This page will include a visualization of data from multiple sources (including Gallup and Pew) on the views of Americans towards fake news and overall trends in trust in media in recent years. The data on declining trust in media will be presented through a (hopefully) interactive line chart with time series data extending as far back as is available. Additional points of interest from recent polling regarding views of fake news in America will be presented in variosu visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs etc...) as necessitated by the data. Ideally, these separate snapshots will be accessible via a sidebar, such that a selection made by the end user will change the visualization on screen.
